#### Entiako Fire Perimeter####



> What this is...

* I created this polygon feature from data I downloaded from the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System. From this dataset I selected this specific fire polygon and created a layer from this selection. Then I transformed that layer to a shapefile in ArcGIS and created my geojson from there. I have included a geojson, a simplified geojson using Visvalingam/weighted area on mapshaper.
